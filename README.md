# GoClean
GoClean is a platform that aims at bringing together individuals to mitigate climate change and global warming. We aim to achieve our target through various features that we have integrated into our website.

### How to host and manage Events?
This is the section where individuals get to know about different ongoing events and also host one if they are interested and can witness their small efforts solving gargantuan real world problems.

### Whare are real Issues prevailing?
Users will be using this feature to raise any issue that they face in their surroundings, like garbage collected on roadsides, mass destruction of trees, vehicles emitting too much of black smoke, industries in residential areas causing hazardous air pollution etc. We will fight together and solve every problem within our capacity instead of just ranting and waiting for authorities to take any step.

### What are the Challenges at hand?
Challenges will help us develop a habit, a habit to protect our environment, which will include planting a certain number of trees/plants for a given period of time, participating in public events, challenge to clean a place which got attention of curse only. They not only contribute to the environment but also etch the sense of satisfaction and happiness within us.

### Our GoClean box
Todayâ€™s irony is that money leads to destruction and the same money helps in conservation and preservation. GoGreen box aims to raise funds with individuals who want to participate in this campaign. This fund will help to increase the use of renewable energy and run out different events effectively.

### Taking care of the air we breathe
This platform gives all the details you should know about the oxygen you are breathing, and, not even realising how harmful it is. It is also an idea to realise everyone that we all are responsible for this and instantly act towards it.

It is really high time we realise the urgency to act towards saving our nature. If we join hands, we can reverse the situation and we strongly believe - Together We Can and Together We Will! And for this, today we present one complete solution, our web-application GoGreen.
